# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
With this application the user can test api routes using the ORM model. The routes that the user will be testing will be GET all, GET single by ID, POST to create new, PUT to update, and DELETE using single ID. In this application we will be testing Product, Categories, and Tag routes. To start the user will want to create the db by going into the command prompt and typing, "source db/schema.sql". Afterwards the user will want to use their terminal to seed the database by typing, "npm run seed". Afterwards the user will start the application by typing, "npm start" in the terminal. The user can then start creating new products with names, stock, price, and category_id. The user can also create new tags and categories to then update products with or add new products to the new categories and tags. This is just a fun playground for testing ORM.
